##QuickSass
This is a Sass Boilerplate for quick set up of projects.
I created this for my own pesonal use, so I can simply <code>$ git clone</code> the repository, add the folder to CodeKit and I'm already set up to go. 


It contains:
* A modular approach to SCSS, broken up into base, layout and modules follwing on from SMACSS
* Base files contain a modularized version of Normalize
