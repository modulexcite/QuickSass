##QuickStart
This is a Sass Boilerplate for quick set up of projects.
I created this for my own pesonal use, so I can simply <code>$ git clone</code> the repository, add the folder to CodeKit and I'm already set up to go. 


It contains:
* A modular approach to SCSS, broken up into modules and partials
* Normalize is also modularized 
* Custom mixins that Compass doesn't have
* Custom placeholders for clearfix and absolute centering
* DNS prefetching for Analytics


###New feature
If on OSX Mavericks, double click local.command to start a localhost. May need to chmod to 775 for it to work.
