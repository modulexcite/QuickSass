##QuickStart
This is a stripped down and adapted version of @toddmotto's FireShell.
I created this for my own pesonal use. Created so I can simply <code>$ git clone</code> the repository, add the folder to CodeKit and I'm already set up to go. 


It contains:
* A modular approach to SCSS, broken up into modules and partials
* Custom mixins that Compass doesn't have
* Custom placeholders for clearfix and absolute centering
* best practices from the HTML5 Boilerplate CSS also broken down into modules
* DNS prefetching for Analytics
